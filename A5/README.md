### **Project Overview**

This project examines Privacy Policy and DNSMPI (Do Not Sell My Personal Information) links across websites. The goal is to understand how these links are implemented, their visibility, and compliance with privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The analysis is divided into three research questions:

1. **RQ1**: Investigates patterns and inconsistencies in DNSMPI link implementations across websites.  
2. **RQ2**: Analyzes the percentage of websites with Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links and explores why some companies might omit or obscure them.  
3. **RQ3**: Examines the placement of Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links on websites and how this affects their accessibility.

### **Steps to Run the Project**

#### **1. Run the Crawler**
To collect website data for analysis:  
- Navigate to the `crawler` folder:
  ```bash
  cd crawler
Follow the instructions in the README.md file to run crawler.py and generate the dataset (scraped_data.json).

2. Run the Analysis Scripts
To analyze the collected data for RQ1 and RQ2:
- Navigate to the `analysis` folder:
  ```bash
  cd analysis
Follow the instructions in the README.md file to execute the scripts (RQ1_script.py and RQ2_script.py) and generate the results.

#### **Crawler Directory**
- **`crawler.py`**  
  - **Description**: The script used to collect website data, including DNSMPI and Privacy Policy links.  
  - **Purpose**: Scrapes website information to create the input dataset for analysis.

- **`websites.txt`**  
  - **Description**: A text file containing the list of websites to be crawled.  
  - **Purpose**: Provides input URLs for the `crawler.py` script.

- **`README.md`**  
  - **Description**: Documentation for running the crawler script.  
  - **Purpose**: Guides users on how to use the crawler for data collection.

#### **Data Directory**
- **`scraped_data.json`**  
  - **Description**: The dataset generated by the crawler, containing website information like Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links.  
  - **Purpose**: Serves as the primary input for analysis scripts.

#### **Analysis Directory**
- **`RQ1_script.py`**  
  - **Description**: The script analyzing patterns in DNSMPI links.  
  - **Outputs**:
    - `RQ1_dnsmpi_patterns_summary.txt`: Summary of DNSMPI tag patterns and their frequencies.
    - `RQ1_dnsmpi_patterns_chart.png`: Bar chart visualizing the most common DNSMPI patterns.

- **`RQ2_script.py`**  
  - **Description**: The script calculating the percentage of websites with Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links.  
  - **Outputs**:
    - `RQ2_link_presence_summary.txt`: Summary of the percentage breakdown.
    - `RQ2_link_presence_chart.png`: Bar chart comparing the presence of Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links.

- **`research-question3-graph.jpg`**  
  - **Description**: A heatmap visualizing the locations of Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links across the analyzed websites.  
  - **Purpose**: Provides a clear visual representation of link placement trends for RQ3.  
  - **Note**: There is no separate script for RQ3, as the heatmap was generated manually or through external tools.

- **`README.md`**  
  - **Description**: Documentation for running the analysis scripts.  
  - **Purpose**: Guides users through executing the scripts for RQ1 and RQ2 and understanding the outputs.

- **Generated Files in Analysis**:
  - `RQ1_dnsmpi_patterns_summary.txt`  
  - `RQ1_dnsmpi_patterns_chart.png`  
  - `RQ2_link_presence_summary.txt`  
  - `RQ2_link_presence_chart.png`  
  - `research-question3-graph.jpg`
