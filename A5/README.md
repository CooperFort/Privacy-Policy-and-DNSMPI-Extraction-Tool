Scraping and Analyzing Privacy Policies

### **Project Overview**

This project examines Privacy Policy and DNSMPI (Do Not Sell My Personal Information) links across websites. The goal is to understand how these links are implemented, their visibility, and compliance with privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The analysis is divided into three research questions:

1. **RQ1**: Investigates patterns and inconsistencies in DNSMPI link implementations across websites.  
2. **RQ2**: Analyzes the percentage of websites with Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links and explores why some companies might omit or obscure them.  
3. **RQ3**: Examines the placement of Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links on websites and how this affects their accessibility.

---

### **Key Findings**

1. **RQ1**: DNSMPI links lack standardization, with a wide variety of terms and inconsistent implementation across websites.
2. **RQ2**: Most high-traffic websites comply with privacy requirements, but smaller sites often lack visibility and accessibility for these tools.
3. **RQ3**: Privacy links are most commonly found in footers, which may hinder their accessibility for users.

### **Steps to Run the Project**

#### **1. Run the Crawler**
To collect website data for analysis:  
- Navigate to the `crawler` folder:
  ```bash
  cd crawler
Follow the instructions in the README.md file to run crawler.py and generate the dataset (scraped_data.json).

2. Run the Analysis Scripts
To analyze the collected data for RQ1 and RQ2:
- Navigate to the `analysis` folder:
  ```bash
  cd analysis
Follow the instructions in the README.md file to execute the scripts (RQ1_script.py and RQ2_script.py) and generate the results.

#### **Analysis Directory**
- **`RQ1_script.py`**  
  - **Description**: The script analyzing patterns in DNSMPI links.  
  - **Outputs**:
    - `RQ1_dnsmpi_patterns_summary.txt`: Summary of DNSMPI tag patterns and their frequencies.
    - `RQ1_dnsmpi_patterns_chart.png`: Bar chart visualizing the most common DNSMPI patterns.

- **`RQ2_script.py`**  
  - **Description**: The script calculating the percentage of websites with Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links.  
  - **Outputs**:
    - `RQ2_link_presence_summary.txt`: Summary of the percentage breakdown.
    - `RQ2_link_presence_chart.png`: Bar chart comparing the presence of Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links.

- **`research-question3-graph.jpg`**  
  - **Description**: A heatmap visualizing the locations of Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links across the analyzed websites.  
  - **Purpose**: Provides a clear visual representation of link placement trends for RQ3.  
  - **Note**: There is no separate script for RQ3, as the heatmap was generated manually or through external tools.

- **`README.md`**  
  - **Description**: Documentation for running the analysis scripts.  
  - **Purpose**: Guides users through executing the scripts for RQ1 and RQ2 and understanding the outputs.

- **Generated Files in Analysis**:
