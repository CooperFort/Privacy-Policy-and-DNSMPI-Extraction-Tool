# README: Instructions for Running the Scripts

This README provides instructions for running the scripts for Research Question 1 (RQ1) and Research Question 2 (RQ2). These scripts analyze Privacy Policy and DNSMPI link patterns based on a provided JSON dataset.

---

## Requirements

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:
**Matplotlib and Pandas**
   - Install required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib
     ```
---

## Files in the Repository

- `RQ1_script.py`: Script for analyzing DNSMPI link patterns.
- `RQ2_script.py`: Script for analyzing the presence of Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links.
- `scraped_data.json`: Example input file (replace with your dataset).
- output files

## How to Run the Scripts

### 1. Running the Script for Research Question 1 (RQ1)

**Purpose**:  
Analyzes DNSMPI tag patterns, generates a ranked list of patterns, and visualizes the top patterns.

**Steps**:
1. Ensure `RQ1_script.py` and `scraped_data.json` are in the same folder.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/scripts

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python RQ1_script.py


### Running the Script for Research Question 2 (RQ2)

**Purpose**:  
The script calculates the percentage of websites with Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links, generates a summary, and visualizes the results in a bar chart.

---

**Steps to Run**:

1. Ensure the following files are in the same directory:
   - `RQ2_script.py`: The script for analyzing Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links.
   - `scraped_data.json`: The JSON file containing the dataset.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the files:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/scripts

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python RQ2_script.py

---

## Outputs

**RQ1 Scipt**:
Text File: RQ1_dnsmpi_patterns_summary.txt contains a ranked list of DNSMPI tag patterns and their frequencies.
Chart: RQ1_dnsmpi_patterns_chart.png shows a bar chart of the top 10 DNSMPI patterns.

**RQ2 Script**:
Text File: RQ2_link_presence_summary.txt provides a summary of the percentages of websites with Privacy Policy and DNSMPI links.
Chart: RQ2_link_presence_chart.png visualizes the percentages of websites with Privacy Policy and/or DNSMPI links.
